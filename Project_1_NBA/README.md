Question 5 : How do the Orlando Magics Player’s Performance compare to similar players in the league?

Orlando’s Players Strengths:
Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero were above the league average in every metric related to scoring directly and/or indirectly.
Starter Markelle Fultz was above league average in field goal percentage.
Starter Markelle Fultz was above league average in assists.
Reserve Guard Gary Harris was above league average in 3pt shooting.
All but one Center was below league average in 3pt shooting.
All but one Guard were below the league average in turnovers.

Orlando’s Players Deficiencies:
Reserve Guards performance in most major statistics categories were at or below league average.
Reserve Forwards performance in most major statistics categories were at or below league average.
Starting Center performance in key role statistics were at or slightly above league average.
All players but Franz Wagner were below the Plus-Minus league average.
All players but Franz Wagner, Kevon Harris, and Goga Bitadze had a negative Plus-Minus.

Findings and Conclusion:
Starting Forwards are the strongest unit of the Orlando Magic Team, performed slightly or above the league average.
Starting Guards and Center were at or slightly above league averageReserve players production in all roles were mainly below league average.Recommend contracting better reserve players in all categories. Their production is not up to par when they are on the floor.Contracting a starting Guard or Center that is performing above the league average and converting your starters into role players. This could increase your reserve production and their individual production shouldn’t dip too much.

Question 4 : To determine which KPIs most closely relate to wins for the Orlando Magic Team in the 2022 -2023 Games.

According to the Pearson Correlation Coefficient Table, the KPIs all had a positive relation to wins.
However, a strong positive relationship to Wins were shown by: 
1) Field Goals Made
2) Free Throws Made
3) Rebounds
Recommendations to the team as a whole to work on 3 Points which have a moderate positive effect on Wins,
and Steals and Blocks which were least related to Win.

Question 3 : How does the Orlando Magic, as a team, compare to other teams in the league and the league as a whole?
### Analysis
### Points
   - The Magic, as a team, are WELL below average in terms of scoring points per game. 
   - There is a high variance amongst points scored which gives us a standard deviation on the higher side, 2.7. This variance is apparent when we look at the league points bar chart. 
   - One interesting point, while the Magic didn’t score as many points as the Milwaukee Bucks who are ranked first in the league, the Bucks themselves didn’t score the most points in the league. 
   - The Sacramento Kings scored by far the most points per game on average. This shows that scoring the most points per game is not the ONLY factor in winning games and being ranked higher.

### 3 Pointers
   - The Magic as a team are still below the lower quartile when it comes to making 3-point shots, but this statistic has a smaller variance between average shots made. The standard deviation is still on the high side but comes in at a more acceptable 1.6. 
   - Orlando’s 3-point percentage is 34.6%. Calculating their 3-point attempts, they only attempt, on average, 31.21 3-point shots per game. This is lower than the average of 34.206. So not only are they not making as many 3-point shots, but they’re also not making as many attempts. 
   - The outliers in this case, The Golden State Warriors and the Boston Celtics, should be investigated further for a better analysis as to what a successful 3-point team looks like.

### Field Goals
   - This statistic is more evenly distributed as we see the Standard Deviation coming down to 1.2. However, our Z-Score remains around the -1 mark and the Magic are once again below the lower quartile.
   - Both the Bucks and the Magic have lower amount of field goals made than the 15th team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
   - I also find it interesting that the Detroit Pistons have not come in last regarding points, 3-pointers, or field goals. So, if they don’t score the least points in the league, what are they struggling with that leaves them in last place? And what can we learn from them to avoid doing?

### Rebounds
   - This is the first KPI that has landed inside of the IQR. The Orlando Magic is comfortably in the middle of the pack when it comes to rebounds.
   - There is a higher variance with this KPI with a Standard Deviation of 2.2. You can see from the bar chart that there is a significant drop from the highest rebounding team to the lowest. 
   - The Milwaukee Bucks are the high outlier of the league with an average 48.6 rebounds per game. I’m wondering if their dominance in this regard has any correlation to the height of the players on their team. 

### Turnovers
   - This Is the first KPI that I have measured where the Magic have come in above the average. The only caveat is that this is not a metric that is good to have a high average in. 
   - The team’s struggle to hold onto the ball may have an impact on their ability to keep the other team from scoring points. 
   - One thing about the bar graph that I find interesting is that the Golden State Warriors, a team who ranks highly in all of our scoring charts, also comes in the highest team in terms of turnovers per game. 
   - One metric that I feel is missing from the data is ‘How Many Points the Other Team Scored Per Game’. We can look at how many points the team scored and how many ball fumbles they had, but the most important metric appears to be, simply, how many points they gave up to the other team. From here I would look into Blocks and Personal Fouls.
